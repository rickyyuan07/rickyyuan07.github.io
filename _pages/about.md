Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my personal website. I am a current Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV) student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My research interests include but not limited to 3D rendering, multi-modal machine learning, model perception, etc. I'm a tech lover and a gamer. I'm actively seeking software/machine learning engineer internship opportunities for Summer 2025. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or opportunities.
