This is my first post of my personal website. Still feels that there's a lot of room for improvement. The workflow of writing blogs on my personal websites might be a bit inconvenient because I have to create every tags of a post and create commits for every post. I might consider using Medium or other platforms for writing blogs. However, it's still a good experience of creating a personal webpage in github to document some of my experiences and backgrounds. I created this websites just to help people understand me and my experiences better, and it might help with my job search.
